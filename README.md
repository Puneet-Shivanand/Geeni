About
This application uses information from SNPedia (snpedia.com) to indicate what genetic
conditions the user has based on their 23andMe file containing their genetic code.
The 23andMe file must be a text file (*.txt) and completely unaltered by the user.

Instructions
Before using this application, ensure that you have an lxml parser installed on
your computer. If you have Python, you can install this parse from your command
line with the command "pip install lxml".

In order to use this application, click on "File" > "Upload File" or press
Ctrl+F on your keyboard to upload your 23andMe file into the program. Then,
when prompted, enter the genetic condition you want the program to work with,
and a table will be displayed with genes you have relating to the condition, along
with information about the gene's chromosome, geontype, magnitude of impact to
condition, and a summary of the gene.

Please be patient when waiting for results to appear. It often takes 30 or more
seconds for information to be returned.

To report bugs, email jpozin3@gatech.edu or jjcs@gatech.edu with a description of
the problem.
